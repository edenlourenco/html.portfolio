    <h2><em>Summary</em></h2>
    <p>My name is João Lourenço, iam 34 years old,live in Portugal, since my first computer Pentium 4, 1.5g 128 mb rim
        with a riva TNT2
        i cant dream without computing. When I was a teenager, I didn't take advantage of what my parents gave me and I
        went to work in a supermarket for economic reasons.
        At 33 I got married, straightened out my life and moved on, now I'm more focused than ever. And I intend to take
        this in the most sporty way but also knowing that later I will be able to do what I really like.
